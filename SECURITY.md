## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities via public GitHub issues.**

If you discover a security vulnerability (especially related to hash collisions, bypass of NTP certification, or buffer overflows), please send an email to the maintainer or use the GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting feature if enabled.

We aim to acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a fix or mitigation strategy within 7 days for critical issues.

## Forensic Integrity Disclosure

If a flaw is found that compromises the **Chain of Custody** or the **Binding Hash** integrity, a security advisory will be issued with high priority to inform the forensic community.
